Create a repo with C++ Gotchas, based on

* katas
* interview tasks
* Dewhurst's books "C++ Gotchas" & similar
* thorough cppreference.com exploration
* C++ FAQs
* examples of cpp gotchas dispersed around the web

Each gotcha got to have (a) task (b) explanation and (c) answer. Maybe, also (d) language standard comment.
