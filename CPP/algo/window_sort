Goal:

- sort with some method data that can't fit into memory

Refs:
(1) - use STL sorts (cppref.)
(2) - look for algos in outer mem

Plan:

1) think: does it mean I should use disk space or be smart with my "Window" of data
3) object scheme - pseudocode - interface - implement
4) test - conclude - commit

Hints:
- dont't use to much data, just make a virtual restriction of window of, say, 1MB
- for data, use some random-numbers generator to create text file of size >= 10MB
